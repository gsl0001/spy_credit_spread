## Six Sidebar Modes

Switch between modes using the sidebar. Strategy + filter config persists in `localStorage` and drives both backtest and live scanner consistently.

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Live** | Connect IBKR TWS — account HUD, monitor heartbeat, alerts, SPY chart, combo order ticket, positions table, kill switch |
| **Paper** | Connect Alpaca paper account — positions, orders, auto-execute on signal |
| **Backtest** | Simulate strategy over historical data, presets, equity curve, optimizer, regime breakdown |
| **Scanner** | Background APScheduler signal scanner — interval / after-open / before-close / on-open cadences, auto-execute toggle |
| **Journal** | SQLite-backed audit trail — open/closed positions, daily P&L, event log, backtest↔live reconciliation |
| **Risk** | Live pre-trade gate display — concurrent cap, daily loss, market-hours, event blackout, buying-power utilization |

---

## Backtester Features

### Entry & Exit Engine

- Mark-to-market pricing on every bar using Black-Scholes (adjusts for theta decay day-by-day)
- Stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop — all configured as % of cost basis
- Expiry-based forced exit when DTE reaches zero
- Direction-aware logic: bull and bear paths both fully implemented and tested

### Position Sizing

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Fixed contracts | N contracts per trade (default) |
| Dynamic sizing | Risk X% of equity per trade, optional dollar max cap |
| Targeted spread % | Size to X% of capital, bounded by max allocation cap |

### Preset System

- 5 built-in presets: Conservative, Aggressive, Post-Crash, Low-Vol Scalp, Bear Market
- Save unlimited custom presets under any name (persisted in `localStorage`)
- Delete custom presets from the UI
- All settings persist across browser sessions

---

## Strategies

### Consecutive Days (Mean Reversion)

Entry fires after N consecutive red candles (bull) or green candles (bear). Exit on M reversal candles or stop loss.

Parameters: `entry_red_days`, `exit_green_days`

### Combo Spread (Trend / Volume Breakout)

Uses SMA(3,8,10) crossdown and EMA(5,3) trend alignment. Two entry conditions: SMA crossdown + EMA confirmation, or low-volume EMA breakout with OHLC average confirmation. Time-based or profit-count based exit.

Parameters: `combo_sma1/2/3`, `combo_ema1/2`, `combo_max_bars`, `combo_max_profit_closes`

### Adding a New Strategy

1. Create `strategies/my_strategy.py` inheriting `BaseStrategy`
2. Implement: `name`, `compute_indicators(df, req)`, `check_entry(df, i, req)`, `check_exit(df, i, state, req)`, `get_schema()`
3. Register in `StrategyFactory.STRATEGIES` in `main.py`

---

## Option Topologies

All pricing uses **Black-Scholes** (European) with 21-day rolling historical volatility and live T-bill risk-free rate (^IRX).

| Topology | Description | Direction | Backtest | Live (IBKR) |
|----------|-------------|-----------|:--------:|:-----------:|
| `vertical_spread` | Bull call spread or bear put spread | bull / bear | ✅ | ✅ |
| `long_call` | ATM long call (auto-swaps to long put on bear) | bull / bear | ✅ | ⚠️ MVP scope |
| `long_put` | ATM long put | bear | ✅ | ⚠️ MVP scope |
| `straddle` | ATM call + ATM put | neutral | ✅ | ⚠️ MVP scope |
| `iron_condor` | OTM put spread + OTM call spread | neutral | ✅ | ⚠️ MVP scope |
| `butterfly` | Long ATM, short 2× OTM, long far OTM | neutral | ✅ | ⚠️ MVP scope |

> **Live execution scope:** Only `vertical_spread` (bull_call) is wired into `/api/ibkr/execute` for the MVP rollout. Other topologies are fully implemented in the backtest engine but require additional QA before live wiring — see `LIVE_TRADING_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`.

**IV Realism Factor**: Multiplied onto historical vol before pricing to account for implied/realized spread. Default `1.15`.

---

## Filters & Risk Controls

### Entry Filters

| Filter | Keys | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| RSI | `use_rsi_filter`, `rsi_threshold` | Oversold/overbought — direction-aware |
| EMA | `use_ema_filter`, `ema_length` | Price above/below EMA confirmation |
| SMA200 | `use_sma200_filter` | Long-term trend filter |
| Volume | `use_volume_filter` | Volume must exceed 20-day MA |
| VIX | `use_vix_filter`, `vix_min/max` | Restrict trades to a VIX band |
| Regime | `use_regime_filter`, `regime_allowed` | Allow only bull/bear/sideways/all |

Regime is computed from 50 SMA vs 200 SMA vs price alignment.

### Exit Controls

| Control | Key | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Stop Loss | `stop_loss_pct` | % loss on cost basis triggers exit |
| Take Profit | `take_profit_pct` | % gain triggers exit (0 = off) |
| Trailing Stop | `trailing_stop_pct` | % drawdown from peak value triggers exit |
| DTE Expiry | `target_dte` | Force exit when days-to-expiry hits 0 |
| Strategy Exit | varies | Each strategy defines its own exit logic |

---

## Performance Analytics

14 metrics displayed after every backtest:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total P&L | Net profit after all commissions |
| Win Rate | % trades closed profitable |
| Sharpe Ratio | Annualized risk-adjusted return |
| Sortino Ratio | Sharpe using only downside deviation |
| Max Drawdown | Largest peak-to-trough equity decline |
| Profit Factor | Gross wins / gross losses |
| Kelly % | Optimal risk fraction (f* = W − (1−W)/R) |
| Recovery Factor | Total P&L / max dollar drawdown |
| Avg Win / Avg Loss | Average winning and losing trade |
| Max Consecutive Losses | Worst losing streak |
| Avg Hold Days | Average trade duration |
| Final Equity | Starting capital + total P&L |

### Analytics Tabs

## Paper Trading — Alpaca

Connect a free [Alpaca paper account](https://alpaca.markets) (API key + secret).

### Features

- **Header HUD** — live equity, buying power, cash when connected
- **Market Scanner** — configurable interval (default 60s), runs strategy signal logic on live yfinance data
- **Signal widget** — SIGNAL FIRING / NO SIGNAL with price, RSI value, RSI filter pass/fail, EMA filter pass/fail
- **Auto-Execute** — when enabled, automatically places a market order when a signal fires
- **Kill Switch** — immediately stops scanner and submits close orders for all open positions
- **30s auto-refresh** of positions and orders while connected
- **Tabs**: Positions · Open Orders · All Orders (with fill prices) · Scan Log (last 30 entries)

### Setup

1. Create a paper account at [alpaca.markets](https://alpaca.markets)
2. Generate API Key + Secret in the dashboard
3. Enter credentials in the Paper mode panel — they are saved in `localStorage`

---

## Live Trading — IBKR TWS

Requires an Interactive Brokers account with **TWS** or **IB Gateway** running locally with API access enabled.

### Features

- **Connection panel** — host / port / client ID config with live status badge (ONLINE / DROPPED / OFFLINE)
- **Header HUD** — net liquidation, buying power, day P&L, unrealized P&L
- **15s heartbeat** — reconnects automatically, timestamp shown in header
- **Market Scanner** — same signal logic as paper mode; auto-scan every 60s option
- **Test Order** — non-filling SPY limit buy at $1.05 to verify TWS connectivity end-to-end
- **Combo Orders** — multi-leg `BAG` contracts built from the topology builder, submitted at midpoint
- **Kill Switch** — stops scanner and cancels all open orders
- **Per-order cancel** button in Open Orders tab
- **30s auto-refresh** of positions and orders while connected

### TWS Configuration

1. Open TWS → `Edit → Global Configuration → API → Settings`
2. Enable `Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients`
3. Set socket port to `7497` (paper TWS) or `7496` (live TWS) or `4001/4002` (IB Gateway)
4. Allow connections from localhost

### Order Types by Topology

| Topology | Legs | Order Structure |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Vertical Spread | 2 | BAG combo — buy/sell calls or puts |
| Long Call / Put | 1 | Single-leg market/limit |
| Straddle | 2 | BAG combo |
| Iron Condor | 4 | BAG combo |
| Butterfly | 3 | BAG combo |

Orders use `LimitOrder` at the midpoint price fetched from TWS. Expiry is approximated as nearest weekday from `today + target_dte`.

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Recently Fixed

- ✅ **UI Stability & Performance** — Fixed render-time crashes on malformed data; optimized scaling and plotting for large datasets.
- ✅ **Idempotency (I5)** — UI and Scanner now generate unique keys to prevent duplicate order execution.
- ✅ **Exponential Backoff (I7)** — Reconnection logic now uses a backoff strategy to handle network instability gracefully.
- ✅ **Backtest Robustness** — Handled `NaN`/`Inf` floats in API responses to prevent serialization errors.
- ✅ **IBKR order direction** — `/api/ibkr/execute` now derives `BUY`/`SELL` from `spread.net_debit` sign.
- ✅ **Silent skip on zero-cost legs** — pricing fallback added in `strategies/builder.py`.
- ✅ **`scanner_state` thread safety** — single-leader election via `core/leader.py` (fcntl flock) prevents race conditions.
- ✅ **Circular import** — shared types extracted; backend imports cleaned up.

### Active Bugs

1. **Iron condor margin is wrong** — credit spreads return `net_cost < 0`, which adds to equity instead of reserving margin. Correct margin = `(strike_width × 100) − abs(net_credit)` per contract.

2. **Double `compute_indicators` call** — engine runs indicators once inside `run_backtest_engine`, then again to build the regime timeline. Adds unnecessary latency.

3. **Expiry snap is approximate** — adds `target_dte` calendar days then snaps to nearest weekday. Real SPY expirations are Mon/Wed/Fri. Should pull actual expirations from the live chain.

4. **`live_chain` is slow** — calls `t.info` (makes a secondary HTTP request). Should use `t.fast_info` and cache with TTL.

5. **Duplicate indicator code** — `consecutive_days` and `combo_spread` each compute RSI, EMA, SMA independently. Should share `_add_base_indicators(df, req)` in `base.py`.

6. **Slippage/commission reconciliation report missing** — journal schema persists commission and slippage columns but no `/api/journal/reconciliation` payload yet aggregates them (tracked as I4 in `LIVE_TRADING_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`).

---

### Next Steps — Priority Order

#### High Priority

- [ ] **Fix iron condor margin** — reserve spread width minus credit instead of crediting to equity
- [ ] **Real expiry resolution** — query `/api/live_chain` to find the nearest actual expiry at or beyond `target_dte`
- [ ] **Extract `models.py`** — move `BacktestRequest`, `StrategyFactory` to a shared module, break circular import

#### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Alpaca options orders** — Alpaca now supports real options; replace equity proxy with actual options leg orders
- [ ] **Live bid/ask pricing** — replace Black-Scholes synthetic pricing in live/paper mode with real bid/ask from yfinance or data feed
- [ ] **Multi-ticker scanning** — scan multiple symbols concurrently, aggregate and display all signals
- [ ] **Schema-driven sidebar** — each strategy already implements `get_schema()`; wire the sidebar to render fields dynamically instead of hardcoded JSX
- [ ] **Scanner thread safety** — wrap `scanner_state` mutations in `asyncio.Lock`
- [ ] **`live_chain` cache** — `t.fast_info` + LRU cache with 60s TTL

#### Low Priority / Enhancements

- [ ] **Export trades to CSV** — download button in the Trades tab
- [ ] **Win rate heatmap** — day-of-week × month heatmap chart in Analytics tab (data already computed server-side)
- [ ] **Signal alerts** — Web Notifications API browser notification when a signal fires during auto-scan
- [ ] **Walk-forward optimizer** — run parameter grid within each walk-forward window to prevent in-sample overfitting
- [ ] **Docker Compose** — containerize backend + frontend for single-command deployment
- [ ] **Rate limiting** — `slowapi` on `/api/backtest` and `/api/optimize` (CPU-intensive)
- [ ] **Test coverage** — pytest suite for `run_backtest_engine`, `compute_analytics`, `OptionTopologyBuilder`, and strategy `check_entry`/`check_exit` (current coverage ~0%)
- [ ] **Mobile layout** — current UI requires ~1200px width; add responsive breakpoints
- [ ] **Dark/light mode toggle**
